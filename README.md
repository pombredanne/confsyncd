# confsyncd

Have you ever wanted to synchronize a config file across multiple servers without  complicated [centralized](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) or [distributed](https://github.com/ha/doozerd) services that provide things like *their own filesystems*?
Confsyncd is a simple ZeroMQ-based solution.

Work in progress.
